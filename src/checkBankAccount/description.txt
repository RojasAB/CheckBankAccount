·        writeCheck –interactivley prompts for an amount to be issued on the check

·        deposit – interactively prompts for an amount to be deposited in the checking account

Create a client that does the following:

·        creates a Checkbook object and invokes the open method at the start of the operation

·        Use all the methods in the class and displays the current balance for every transaction
